# Programming Assignment 7: Runge Kutta Methods

Problems can be found on Canvas.

## Format of Submission

In this assignment, the submission repository or zip file should only contain **one source file** if using ``MATLAB`` or ``Python``. If you use a programming language other than ``MATLAB`` or ``Python``, please submit all the necessary files to run the code.

- If you are using ``MATLAB``, please edit the file ``hw07.m`` and follow the instructions in the file.
- If you are using ``Python``, please edit the file ``hw07.py`` and follow the instructions in the file.

## Submission Guidelines

Please include **your name** and **email address** on the 1st line in the source files.

The programming part of homework assignments should be submitted separately to Canvas. To submit your work, follow the instructions in each homework and ensure your code has passed all the preliminary tests.

- For MATLAB users, run the command under the same directory of the homework in MATLAB to check your code:

```matlab
hw_test
```

- For Python users, run the command under the same directory of the homework in the terminal to check your code:

```bash
pytest hw_test.py
```

After passing the tests, you can submit your work either by

- Push your code to your GitHub repository and submit the public link of the repository to Canvas.
- or create a zip file of your code and submit it to Canvas.

**Important: Any submission that fails to pass the sample tests will be counted as 0 points directly.**
